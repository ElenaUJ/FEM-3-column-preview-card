## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM methodology
- ITCSS
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

First and foremost, this is my first frontendmentor challenge and my second HTML/CSS  project in my life. I started a web development course a few weeks ago and built a simple website with their instructions. So, now, for the first time I had to come up with my own solutions. I got to apply what I had learned in the weeks before. I practiced and learnt a lot! Coming up with my own HTML and CSS structure and solutions, thinking of names for HTML classes, understanding and practicing CSS variables and grid a bit more, googling and figuring out a few new CSS properties. It's been very rewarding!

This CSS property was new to me:

overflow: hidden;

And these are properties I understad better now

.button {
  display: inline-block;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: inherit;
}

### Continued development

I want to complete more challenges, to practice what I have learned and finding new solutions. In particular, I would like to learn to use CSS grid in a more complex way. Also, I want to find out if there are better ways to standardize box layout properties like padding, margin, centering of elements.
